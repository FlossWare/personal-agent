# agent-ai

> **Retired architecture:** This repository is the predecessor to [FlossWare/loom-ai](https://github.com/FlossWare/loom-ai). New execution and orchestration work belongs in Loom. This repository is retained for historical reference and migration of reusable implementation.

FlossWare's provider-neutral agent execution/orchestration stack built around a **worker / arbiter** architecture.

## Core model

A **worker is any capable unit of work**. It is not synonymous with an LLM. A worker may be deterministic code, a CLI, MCP capability, another agent, a local model, a hosted model, a test runner, or a composite worker.

```text
Work
  -> capability matching
  -> Workers
       -> deterministic tool
       -> CLI
       -> MCP capability
       -> agent
       -> model
       -> composite worker
  -> Arbiter
       -> collect evidence
       -> detect disagreement
       -> synthesize
  -> Result
```

The arbiter is the synthesis boundary. Model-based consensus is one possible synthesis implementation, not a prerequisite for the architecture.

## Engineering workflow

```text
Task -> isolated worktree -> Worker -> Tests -> Hard gates -> Arbiter -> Accept/Reject -> Apply
```

1. Each run can execute in a disposable git worktree.
2. A coding worker investigates, plans, changes files, and runs tests.
3. Deterministic hard gates can reject failures regardless of model output.
4. An independent arbiter reviews the proposed result.
5. Rejection feeds actionable feedback back to the worker for another iteration.
6. Accepted changes can be applied to the primary tree.

## Provider and pricing neutrality

Provider, model, vendor, hosting topology, authentication mechanism, and pricing are **routing and policy inputs**, not architectural defaults. The runtime does not require or prefer a particular provider or pricing tier.

See `personal_agent/capability.py` for the generic capability-worker contract and `personal_agent/arbiter.py` for the arbiter implementation.

## Installation

`agent-ai` is the historical execution/orchestration layer. Installation, profiles, provider/model discovery, diagnostics, and Crush provisioning belonged to the separate `agent-setup` control plane, now being replaced by `loom-setup` and `loom-client-setup`.

The current canonical execution/orchestration runtime is:

https://github.com/FlossWare/loom-ai

For development of this historical repository:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e '.[dev]'
pytest -q
```

## Quick start

```bash
cd /path/to/your/git/repository
pa --investigate "What are the main components?" --repo .
pa "Fix the failing test in test_auth.py" --repo . --commands pytest --max-iter 3
```

Do not use `--commit` on the first dogfood run. Review the generated diff and verification results first.

## Usage examples

### CLI

```bash
pa --investigate "What are the main components?" --repo .
pa "Fix the failing test in test_auth.py" --repo . --commands pytest --max-iter 3
pa -v "Summarize the security model" --repo . --json
```

### Python API, provider-neutral workers

```python
import asyncio
from personal_agent import CapabilityArbiter, FunctionWorker, Work

async def main():
    workers = [
        FunctionWorker("static-check", {"inspect"}, lambda work: "static evidence"),
        FunctionWorker("tests", {"inspect", "verify"}, lambda work: "tests evidence"),
    ]
    result = await CapabilityArbiter(workers).execute(
        Work("inspect repository", frozenset({"inspect"}))
    )
    print(result.conclusion)

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Python API, coding loop

```python
import asyncio
from personal_agent import CodingAgent
from personal_agent.types import Task

async def main():
    repo = "/path/to/git/repository"
    agent = CodingAgent(repo, max_iterations=3)
    task = Task(
        description="Fix the failing test in test_auth.py",
        repo_path=repo,
        commands=["pytest"],
        max_iterations=3,
    )
    result = await agent.run(task)
    print(result.decision, result.iterations)
    # Review result.final_diff and result.arbiter_decisions before any commit.

asyncio.run(main())
```

Configure provider credentials in the parent process via the historical setup tooling or an OS secret store. Workers remain credential-free. Integration coverage lives under `tests/`.

## Credentials and safety

Credentials belong to the authentication boundary and must not be embedded in source, generated configuration, images, or Git history.

- command policy and filesystem confinement (`docs/COMMAND-POLICY.md`)
- credential isolation and secret redaction (`docs/SECURITY.md`)
- deterministic verification gates
- disposable worktrees
- independent arbitration

See [`docs/SECURITY.md`](docs/SECURITY.md) for the threat model and credential boundaries.

## Testing

```bash
pytest -q
```

The repository contains focused tests for worker contracts, arbitration, routing, security, verification, repository operations, and the end-to-end agent loop. Coverage is measured in CI rather than represented by a hand-maintained percentage in this README.

## Troubleshooting and known limitations

See [`docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for common installation, credential, worktree, router, and rejection-loop failures.

| Limitation | Notes |
|------------|-------|
| Python **3.11+** | Required by `requires-python`. |
| Fedora Tier-1 | Historical dogfood path; new work belongs in Loom. |
| `--max-iter` default **3** | Bounds cost and runaway reject loops. |
| Git `HEAD` dependency pins | Historical dogfood policy; use release tags or immutable SHAs for reproducible releases. |

Dependency policy is documented in [`docs/VERSIONING.md`](docs/VERSIONING.md).

## Architecture boundaries

This repository represents the predecessor architecture. The current boundaries are:

- **loom-ai**: execution and orchestration runtime
- **loom-setup**: Loom runtime installation and configuration
- **loom-client-setup**: external client integration with Loom
- **model-gateway**: provider-neutral model invocation, resources, routing, and selection
- **consensus-ai**: reusable consensus and arbitration strategies where still applicable

Existing capability libraries should be reused rather than duplicated. Reusable mechanisms from this repository should be migrated into Loom where they fit the current contracts rather than preserving a parallel agent architecture.
